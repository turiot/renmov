		<p>The purpose of this small application is to synchronize two initially similar directories, but one of which has renamed and moved files, to apply the same modifications to the second.</p>
		<p>The typical use case is that of a backup on 'dir1' of 'dir2'; after classifying files in dir2 (renaming and moving files in sub-directories), if we make a new backup, we are offered copy+deletes on dir1 which is inefficient.</p>
		<p>The application detects the actions performed on dir2, relying on the size and the date of update (assumed unchanged by the classification), and proposes to perform the same renaming/moving operations on the target directory dir1.</p>
		<p>Operating mode : choose directories 1 (target that will be modified) and 2 (model), press 'search'; select the items to update then press 'execute'.</p>
		<p>A setting allows to log the actions in a file, to round the times to the second and to choose the language.</p>
